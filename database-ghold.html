                        After some time, Nikhel and Ghold were discussing the potential success of the E5, as the preparations were a success. Sihlvir appeared and stated her dissatisfaction for lending her Talisman and that they had had it for too long. Ghold reminded her that she was safe as the others were on watch, but she explained that that was not what she meant. Ghold then taunted her by asking if it was <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-cyborg-x.html">Cyborg X</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-shinobi.html">Shinobi</a> that she was afraid of, but Nikhel interupted and reminded Sihlvir that they were using her Talisman as she drew the short straw. He then went on to say that their bickering brought up a good point since Ghold mentioned Cyborg X and Shinobi. Ghold then stated that while they tested the E5 he would act as the bait to draw the attention of the two heroes away.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        Later that day, Ghold barged into a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">restaurant</a> and demanded to the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">hostess</a> for food or else everyone there would die. With the poor girl frozen in fear, Ghold intended to stay true to his words as he prepared to strike her down, but a crying <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-amy.html">girl</a> suddenly shouted for the monster to stop. With the events feeling eerily similar to a recent nightmare she experienced where many people died in front of her, the girl declared that she did not want to watch anyone die, surprising and confusing everyone. Claiming she was brave, Ghold decided to grant her an explanation on why he was there before killing her. He twisted the truth by stating that a pair of heroes named Cyborg X and Shinobi have recently appeared bringing with them a surge of hope and a longing for justice and that he wanted to remind the masses that malevolence was still as mighty as ever. Ghold then extended one of his mechanical limbs over to the girl in an attempt to claim his new target as his first victim. Seeing the girl in danger, a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-andrew.html">boy</a> jumped up and tried attacking Ghold, only for his punch to do no damage whatsoever. Ghold instead brought the girl back towards him with his retractable arm and threw her into the boy, sending the two flying into tables with a force that would surely leave anyone heavily injured. Unfortunately for Ghold, the Talisman that was hanging around his neck had touched the boy's hand during his desperate attack and had seemingly appeared around his neck instead. As the dust cleared from the area where the boy and the girl were thrown, the boy stood holding the girl, the two of them unharmed. The boy claimed that he wanted to give that punch another shot. Noticing that the boy now had his Talisman, Ghold took the same hostess from before as a hostage, telling the boy to give him the Talisman and in return he would spare everyone. Instead, the boy distracted Ghold by quickly throwing a knife, which caught him off guard long enough for the boy to jump in close for a second attempt at a punch. With his fist hitting Ghold's metallic gut, Ghold flew through multiple booths before crashing through the wall and landing outside unconscious. As the storm had passed, Sihlvir <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">appeared</a> in a bolt of lightning that struck the ground near the unconscious Ghold. Before she could attempt to take back the Talisman, the Ghold woke up and ordered for her to stop, as he wanted to get revenge; however, while powering up a strange cloak of darkness around himself, he ultimately decided to stop as he, unbeknownst to the others, noticed the duo, Cyborg X and Shinobi, on the roof of the restaurant. Ghold and Sihlvir then fled the scene in a bolt of lightning, but not before Ghold threatened to eventually reclaim the Talisman and kill the boy.

                        Ghold is slightly hot-headed, but often stays calm. He is the leader of his group, and he respects the other members under him, although he does like to playfully tease Sihlvir since she is likely to react. He is quite intelligent, but not as intelligent as one of the other group members, Nikhel. He also has a good sense for reading a situation and making the most beneficial choice.

                        Ghold is a tall male of an unknown species with cybernetic enhancements. His skin is pink, and the horn on the top left of his head is a paler pink. The right side of his head has a metallic plating and the horn is metallic. His ears and the sides of his head are also metallic. He has gold shoulder pads attached to a gold metallic torso. His left arm goes down to a gold gauntlet with a red symbol on it. Attached to the top side of it is a long blade, and his right arm is the same, although the upper part of that arm is small and pipe-like and protrudes from a cylinder-shaped and cone-shaped robotic shoulder. The bottom part of his torso is a black cylinder attached to gold metallic hips with a red marking. His upper legs are black robotics, and his lower legs and feet are gold. He also has a long mettalic tail.

                        When Ghold first appeared at the restaurant, he wore a brown cloak that covered most of his body including a hood that covered most of his head. Holding the cloak closed is a single circular gold medal with a red symbol on it.
