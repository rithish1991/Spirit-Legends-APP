As Shinobi moves his foot, Andrew tightens his fist. Shinobi lunges forward with his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">sword</a> still gripped in his hand and swings it. A <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">beam of energy</a> shoots towards Andrew, who, recognizing the move, uses his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Gravity Push</a> to block the attack. Just as the techniques dissipate, Shinobi surprises Andrew with a punch to the face. The <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Dark Spirit</a> tells Andrew to concentrate and remember that Andrew's senses are heightened while fused with him. Andrew then blocks a kick from Shinobi and excitedly comments to the Dark Spirit that he saw it. The Dark Spirit then tells him to counterattack, and Andrew goes for a punch. Shinobi blocks this punch with the hand that he punched with earlier and uses the sword in his other hand to thrust forward. Andrew moves his head in time and uses another Gravity Push to send Shinobi flying away from him and towards the direction that <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-matt.html">Matt</a> is in. The Dark Spirit asks Andrew if he is okay as Andrew wipes blood from the newly formed cut on his cheek thanks to Shinobi's blade and assures him that he is okay. Shinobi then comments that using the Gravity Push so freely will take its toll on Andrew since he is new to it and asks if the spirit of the Talisman has not taught him that. Andrew attempts to ask Shinobi how he knows about the Dark Spirit, but he is interrupted by the Dark Spirit who tells him that it is true and that their fusion will drain Andrew's energy fast if he is not accustomed to it. He tells Andrew that it is time to go on the offensive before it is too late. Andrew begins to doubt that he can even touch Shinobi, and the Dark Spirit tells him that it is time to learn something new.

                        Meanwhile, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Leo Redfeld</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Clara Valentino</a> do battle with <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-cyborg-x.html">Cyborg X</a>. Both of them are shooting their <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">guns</a>, but Clara stops and puts hers away as she changes up their strategy. She reaches for a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">knife</a> fastened to her lower back and charges towards Cyborg X while telling Leo to cover her. Leo accepts, and Cyborg X, who is dodging the bullets, comments that said bullets are really annoying, and he jumps into the air. He then notices Clara flying toward him from his side, and he raises his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">gun arm</a> in her direction. Before he can shoot her, Leo knocks his gun arm out of the way with a gunshot, which results in it being fired in a different direction, and Clara successfully impales Cyborg X in his abdominal area. Cyborg X coughs up blood, and Clara kicks him to the ground below. She then lands, points to the fire escape, and begins to tell Leo they should go, but before she can finish speaking, Cyborg X shoots another blast at the fire escape and destroys it. His wound <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">heals</a>, and he asks them if they would care for another dance.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        We then cut back to Andrew, whose eyes are closed and is charging the element of darkness into his right hand while Shinobi watches on. He asks the Dark Spirit if he is doing it, to which the Dark Spirit responds by telling him to open his eyes and see for himself. He does so and, upon realizing his success, jumps for joy and shouts that it worked. Shinobi thinks to himself that Andrew has learned to focus the element into his body and that he might need to step things up a bit. He then reaches for the other blade on his back. The Dark Spirit tells Andrew to go forth and feel the Dark Spirit's instincts infused within him, and Andrew charges towards Shinobi with his right hand still charged with darkness. As Shinobi fires a beam of energy from the second blade that he drew, the Dark Spirit tells Andrew to jump. Andrew does so and twirls in the air. As he aims for Shinobi, he feels confident that he has got him. Shinobi responds with another beam of energy from his other blade, but Andrew realizes that he is unable to use his Gravity Push like before and takes the brunt of the attack. He lands to the ground, and the darkness charged in his hand disappears. Shinobi points one of his blades towards Andrew's heads and asks if he has had enough. The Dark Spirit asks Andrew if he can still stand, and Andrew tells him that Shinobi is totally out of his league. Shinobi then asks Andrew how he can expect to fight those horned cyborgs like this. Andrew begins to respond, but Shinobi continues by saying that Andrew can either get up or give up, but they will not give him a choice. Andrew is able to stand and makes a fist with his right hand. He lets out a roar and charges towards Shinobi once more, who kicks him in the face and sends him flying back a bit, but Andrew lands on his feet and swing his fist at Shinobi. Before the blow can connect, Shinobi blocks the punch with his blades, and Andrew swings his other fist to push on through. Shinobi's arms swing back as he leans back, and Andrew rushes forwards with the same fist aimed at Shinobi. Shinobi charges his blades with the same energy that he used for his beams, which strengthens them enough to pierce through the cement, and he uses them as a stand for him to now hold onto and kick upward and at Andrew. Before his attack can connect however, Andrew successfully pulls off one more Gravity Push, which forces Shinobi to lose his grip on his blades and send him downward to the ground below. Andrew once again charges his right hand with darkness, and, this time, successfully pulls off the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Shadow Claw</a>. Unfortunately, the overuse of the powers that he had used forces him to pass out. The Shadow Claw disappears, and he falls on top of Shinobi unconscious. His fusion with the Dark Spirit wears off, and Shinobi lets out a sigh as he pushes Andrew off of him. As he begins to sit up, Matt freaks out and attempts a fighting stance while asking if Andrew is okay. Shinobi tells him to relax as he is fine. He explains that he had just passed out from overusing those powers, and he continues to say that he is not the bad guy. He goes on to tell Matt that there are things going on that Matt could never imagine and that he needed to make sure that Andrew was ready to face the worst. He says that Andrew has a lot to learn, but he has the will to do so. Matt asks if this really was just a test, and Shinobi confirms and says that Andrew "passed with flying colors" as he had put it. Shinobi and Matt look down at the sleeping Andrew and smile.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        On the other side of the barrier, Cyborg X continues his battle with Leo and Clara. He shoots towards Leo with his arm canon, and Leo dodges the blast. Leo tells Clara that it looks like they are going to have to kick things up a notch, but before they can they notice the barrier dissipate. Cyborg X recognizes this as a signal and comments that it happened fast. With Andrew over his shoulder, Shinobi shouts from a rooftop to Cyborg X that he will leave the rest to him and throws a smoke bomb at his feet. When the smoke clears, Shinobi and Andrew are gone. While Clara and Cyborg X remain aimed at each other, Leo runs towards Matt and asks if everything is okay and what happened. Just then, the backup that Leo had requested for shows up. A bunch of police cars block off the area and demand that Cyborg X stay right where he is and that he is under arrest. He playfully lifts his hands into the air. Leo tells one of the police that they were too late, who responds by asking what had happened and where Andrew is. Leo explains that Shinobi ran off with him and that they would have to see if they could get any information out of Cyborg X. Before he could finish, the officers near Cyborg X realize that he is a hologram being created by a small <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">device</a> on the ground. It lets out a beeping noise and follows up with an explosive sound wave, knocking back the officers and some of their cars. The real Cyborg X then dashes towards Matt from behind and points his gun arm to his head saying to the officers that it is about time he wraps things up on his end as well.

Andrew winds up getting a cut on his face from Shinobi's blade. Shinobi explains to Andrew that using his powers too much would take their toll on him since he is not used to using them. The Dark Spirit begins to teach Andrew something new.

                                Andrew successfully channels a concentrated amount of darkness in his hand in order to use for an attack on Shinobi. Realizing this, Shinobi decides to step things up a bit and begins to wield both of the blades on his back instead of just one. Andrew is unable to use his Gravity Push due to overusing the powers. Shinobi wanrs him that the horned cyborgs would not give him the option of giving up, and Andrew tries once again to land his attack. This time, he almost succeeds in using the Shadow Claw, but he passes out from overuse of the powers.
