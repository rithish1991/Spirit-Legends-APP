                    When <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-ghold.html">Ghold</a> showed up at a local <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">restaurant</a> to bait both Cyborg X and Shinobi away from his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">group's</a> testing of the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">E5</a> at their <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">base</a>, Cyborg X intercepted text messages and phone calls from within the restaurant regarding the situation, and he and Shinobi showed up to assess the situation. Overlooking from the rooftop, they saw that both <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-sihlvir.html">Sihlvir</a> and Ghold were about to attack a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-andrew.html">boy</a> wearing Ghold's <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Talisman</a>. Ghold noticed the two heroes on the rooftop and stopped his attack. Despite Sihlvir's protests, the two monsters fled the scene in a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">bolt of lightning</a>, but not before Ghold threatened to eventually reclaim the Talisman and kill the boy. Shinobi and Cyborg X secretly overlooked the aftermath of the scene where police and a news crew showed up to the scene, and they watched as the paramilitary organization, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">PALADUS</a>, stepped in.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    Three days later, after Andrew was walking home from <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">school</a> with his best friend, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-matt.html">Matt</a> and the two PALADUS bodyguards, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Leo Redfeld</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Clara Valentino</a>, following closely behind them, Shinobi and Cyborg X made their appearance. Cyborg X interrupted Andrew and mocked the two guards, and they reacted by holding them at <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">gunpoint</a> and asking why they were there. Shinobi claimed that they came to test the boy, but Leo demanded that they come with them as they could not allow that. As this was what they predicted would happen, Cyborg X voiced this thought, and Shinobi created a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">barrier</a> separating himself, Cyborg X, Leo, and Clara from Andrew and Matt, prompting Leo to call for backup. Shinobi then jumped over the barrier and launched a strange <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">energy attack</a> from one of the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">two blades</a> that he grabbed from his back. The attack knocked Andrew into the barrier, causing him to seemingly pass out. While Cyborg X prevented Leo and Clara from any attempts to get to Andrew, Shinobi launched another attack at Andrew, to which Andrew reacted by using his gravity powers to push himself off the floor, push Matt out of the way, and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">deflect</a> the attack, claiming that he would pass Shinobi's test with flying colors. Shinobi made the first move, swinging his blade once again and shooting the same energy attack as before. Andrew successfully blocked the attack by once again using his gravity powers. Once the deflective power wore off, Shinobi ran up to Andrew and unleashed a punch to his face. Unbeknownst to Shinobi, Andrew used the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Dark Spirit's</a> advice. Andrew saw a kick by Shinobi and successfully blocked it with his hands, preparing for a counterattack at the Dark Spirit's behest. Andrew's punch was blocked by Shinobi; however, who followed up with a thrust of his blade that cut Andrew's cheek. Andrew pushed Shinobi back with his powers once again and touched the blood on his cheek, reassuring the Dark Spirit that he was okay when he asked. Shinobi warned Andrew that using the Gravity Push so freely while being new to such powers would take their toll on Andrew and asked if the Dark Spirit had not taught him that. Andrew began to ask Shinobi how he knew of the Dark Spirit, but stopped as he began conversing with the Dark Spirit.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    Shinobi watched as Andrew attempted to gather darkness in his right hand and jump in joy for succeeding. Grabbing the other blade on his back, Shinobi swung it, sending another energy attack towards Andrew. Andrew jumped over it and aimed to fall towards Shinobi, but Shinobi countered with another energy attack from his other blade. Andrew attempted to use his Gravity Push once more, but it did not work thanks to overusing it. He got hit by Shinobi's attack, lost his grip on the darkness gathered in his hand, and fell to the ground below. Shinobi asked him if he had enough, and the Dark Spirit asked Andrew if he could still stand, to which he responded that Shinobi was out of his league. Shinobi asked Andrew how he could expect to fight the horned cyborgs like this, adding in that he could get up or give up, but the cyborgs would not give him a choice. Feeling motivated, Andrew stood up once more and ran towards Shinobi in an attempt to punch him, but Shinobi countered with a kick, sending Andrew backwards; however, Andrew followed up with the punch once more, to which Shinobi responded by blocking it with his swords crossed. Andrew followed up by punching the crossed swords with his other hand, breaking through Shinobi's block. Shinobi fell backwards and stabbed the ground behind him with his swords in order to prop himself up for a kick to Andrew, but Andrew successfully activated his Gravity Push once more, pushing Shinobi to the ground below. While still above Shinobi, Andrew gathered darkness into his right hand once again and unleashed the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Shadow Claw</a> technique that he was planning on using earlier, but before he could strike with it, the energy dissipated and Andrew fell unconscious, falling on Shinobi below him. Freaking out a bit, Matt asked Shinobi if Andrew was okay, but Shinobi assured him that he only passed out from overusing his powers and that he was not the bad guy. He told Matt that there were things going on that he could never imagine and that he needed to make sure that Andrew was ready to face the worst. He claimed that Andrew had a lot to learn but he had the will to do so. Matt asked if it was true that it really was just a test, and Shinobi reassured him that it was and that Andrew passed. Shinobi then deactivated the barrier, to which Cyborg X took as a signal and noted that Shinobi and Andrew's battle was fast. Shinobi called to Cyborg X from a rooftop. With Andrew unconscious and over his shoulder, he said that he would leave the rest to him and threw a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">smoke bomb</a> below him. As the smoke cleared, he and Andrew were gone.

A puffy purple material rests around his neck and on top of a black material with gold edges that acts as shoulder pads. Underneath this is a black mesh material on top of a thin black material covering his torso and arms. On top of this and connected to the front left side of his shoulder pads is a brown belt that has three compartments for carrying items. On his back is another brown belt connected to the back right side of his shoulder pads and travelling down to the back left side of the belt around his waist, and attached to this belt on his back are two perpendicular sword holsters that carry his two large swords. The other ends of the belts are connected to another brown belt with a silver buckle that wraps around his waist. On the left side of this belt a purple cloth holds his sword. He wears black baggy pants that are tucked into black armor around each lower leg with gold edges on each side. The same limb armor can also be seen on each of his forearms, but on these ones are silver blades. On his feet he wears black boots, and on his hands he wears black gloves.</p>
