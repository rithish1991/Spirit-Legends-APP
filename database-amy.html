                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        During a pep rally at her <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">school</a>, Amy ran onto the field into the arms of her <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">boyfriend</a>, much to <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-andrew.html">Andrew's</a> despair as he looked on from the bleachers. Since pep rallies always meant half-days at school, Amy went with her friends, Claire and Elizabeth, to a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">restaurant</a> afterwards, where she complained that with an exaggerated sigh of annoyance that the sudden lightning storm had caused her boyfriend's football game to be cancelled. A mysterious cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-ghold.html">figure</a> then barged into the establishment and threw off its rain-soaked cloak, revealing a humanoid creature with horns and metalic body parts as well as one of the five <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Talismans</a> around its neck, particularly the one with black and white markings on it. Amy watched on as the being briefly locked eyes with her and proceeded to move on to nastily ask who was going to serve him, to which a hostess named <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Jess</a> nervously asked where he would like to sit. The monster then slammed his hand onto the counter, cracking it and leaving a mark in the process. He shouted that he would not be sitting anywhere. He then went on to explain that it was a special day, as if the sudden bad weather did not already give that away. He then told the hostess to stop cowaring behind the desk and prepare for him a feast of unimaginable glory or else everyone there would die. This scared Amy, and Elizabeth tried to get Amy's attention to sit down, as Amy was standing frozen in fear. Claire asked Elizabeth why she was just standing there, to which Elizabeth responded that she thought that she was too scared to move. Claire thought to herself that it must have had something to do with Amy's recent nightmare in which a man wearing the same Talisman that the creature was wearing massacred dozens of innocent people including her own family. With the poor hostess also frozen in fear, the horned menace intended to stay true to his words as he prepared to strike her down, but a crying Amy suddenly shouted for the monster to stop. With the events reminding her of her recent nightmare, Amy declared that she did not want to watch anyone die, surprising and confusing everyone. Claiming she was brave, the figure decided to grant her an explanation on why he was there before killing her, stating that a pair of heroes named <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-cyborg-x.html">Cyborg X</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-shinobi.html">Shinobi</a> had recently appeared bringing with them a surge of hope and a longing for justice and that he wanted to remind the masses that malevolence was still as mighty as ever. The cyborg then<!-- <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">extends</a> --> extended one of his mechanical limbs over to Amy in an attempt to claim his new target as his first victim. Seeing Amy in danger, Andrew jumped up and tried attacking the monster, only for his punch to do no damage whatsoever. The creature instead brought Amy back towards himself with his retractable arm and threw her into Andrew, sending the two flying into tables with a force that would surely leave anyone heavily injured. Miraculously, the strange pendant that was hanging around the being's neck had touched Andrew's hand during his desperate attack and had seemingly appeared around Andrew's neck instead. As the dust cleared from the area where Andrew and Amy were thrown, Andrew, who was sporting a changed appearance, stood holding Amy, the two of them unharmed. With Amy in his arms, everyone seemed surprised, the monster included, and Andrew claimed that he wanted to give that punch another shot.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        As Andrew helped Amy stand and she backed away, Andrew and the creature exchanged words. Andrew was able to trick him and deliver a punch powerful enough to send him flying through multiple booths and through a wall, landing outside of the restaurant and onto the pavement unconscious. The onlookers, Amy included, were astonished, as well as Andrew himself. As the patrons of the restaurant began to crowd around Andrew and talk, Claire asked Amy if she was not going to thank Andrew, but Amy was stunned as she began to see a resemblence between Andrew's new appearance and the murderous figure from her recent nightmare. Elizabeth then noticed that it stopped raining and asked about it, but just then, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">lightning struck</a> the ground near the creature outside. As the bright light faded, another new mysterious cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-sihlvir.html">figure</a> appeared from where the lightning had struck. Andrew and the new figure exchanged some words, which almost resulted in a fight, but the first creature woke up and told the second one to wait as Andrew was his. A strange dark energy flowed around the first creature's body, but he deactivated his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">technique</a> after noticing <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Cyborg X</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Shinobi</a> on the rooftop, unbeknownst to everyone else. After exchanging some more words, including the first creature threatening Andrew's life, the two retreated in another bolt of lightning. Eventually, police showed up to the scene as well as a news crew, who reported on the events.
