                        The issue opens with the narrator explaining that, approximately 3,500 years ago, a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">temple</a> was built to worship a strange race of beings that claimed to come from the sky. They taught humans many things, but their real intention was to hide a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">mysterious orb</a>. In fact, it is said that the temple was meant to hide the orb, and they claimed that only Earth could hide it. But a long forgotten apocalytic event may be the reason the temple now hides something else. The narrator assures the reader that there is no reason to worry, since it is just a myth, but then asks the reader if that is true.
                    </p>

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        We then flashforward to the present, where two explorers come across the Ancient Ruins - the temple from the legend - in the Andes Mountains in Argentina, South America. As the two begin walking into the entrance and down a dark hallway, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">one of the explorers</a> exclaims that he is so excited as he must know what is inside the sacred temple. With a glowing <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">sphere</a> in his hand, he goes on to state that, according to the legends, it is the key to opening the tomb that they have been researching for years. <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">The other explorer</a> calmly asks if today is the day, and his partner confirms that it is indeed the day that they will go behind the door. The calm one laughs to himself that he guesses leaving his dojo for a few days is worth it, to which his partner confidently confirms this. The two of them stop at the end of the hallway where a giant door blocks their path. The sphere begins to glow even brighter, and the calm explorer suddenly gets excited over the sight of the artwork on the door, as it is the first time that he is able to see it so clearly. The explorer holding the sphere places it in the indentation on the door, and the door begins to raise into the ceiling with it, revealing a room with strange horned skeletons holding various weapons, gold pushed to the walls, what seemed like multiple colored flames on the walls, and a red carpet leading to some steps to a giant design on a wall with five <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">mysterious items</a> attached to it. The explorer who previously had the sphere walks into the room and steps on tripwire. The other explorer notices this and calls out his partner's nickname, Jules, to which the clueless man responds by telling him to stop calling him that, but before he could finish stating that his partner knew what he preferred being called, he notices a giant ball attached to a chain swinging towards him. Jules' partner then lunges forward, grabbing him and landing to safety as the ball crashes into a wall, scattering gold and debris. Jules' partner then asks if Jules is alright, to which he confirms and thanks his friend. As Jules' partner states that that was a close call and that they should stay together, Jules thinks about how the room was booby trapped even though it was sealed shut, making him further wonder if the need to take such precautions means something that he knows of resides there. Despite the danger and his friend's objection, Jules runs ahead and safely makes it to the large engraving on the wall, exclaiming that he has found the five Talismans. As Jules' partner catches up, he asks if he knew what was there the whole time, to which Jules keeps silent as he begins pulling the Talismans out of the wall. He starts with the one with the black and white markings and the one with the purple and brown markings. His partner decides that since Jules was too excited to talk that he would be admiring the weaponry that a nearby skeleton was holding. Jules' friendly demeanor quickly changes as he claims that, as his partner is the brawns of the expedition, he is no longer required. He pulls out a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">gun</a>, and his partner asks what is going on. Jules explains that he was using him from the beginning. Just then, the two of them notice four of the colored flames go out (the black, white, purple, and brown ones), and Jules' now ex-partner points it out. Jules asks if he meant the aura channels, laughing to himself due to seemingly knowing what they are. Unfortunately for him, this distracted him just long enough for his ex-partner to swing the weapon that he was admiring and slash Jules' chest. Claiming that he does not know what Jules is planning but that he has a feeling that he can not let Jules have the Talismans, Jules' ex-partner dashes forward and grabs the two mysterious pendants that Jules dropped while Jules himself instead grabs the gun that he dropped. As the quick-witted man finds himself in midair over his injured friend on the floor below him, the wounded Jules kicks upwards, hitting his ex-partner in the chest. Jules then points his gun towards him with his irises now red and his pupils shaped like a vertical line telling his ex-partner to die, surprising him. Without seeing the results, we hear a gunshot before flashing forward seventeen years later.

                        We then see a young man named <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-andrew.html">Andrew</a> sitting on bleachers and looking to the sky. He is at a pep rally at his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">school</a>, and he yawns, wondering why high school pep rallies are so boring. Suddenly he sees his unrequited love, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-amy.html">Amy</a>, run onto the field. His admiration quickly turns into despair, however, as he witnesses her leap into the arms of her <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">boyfriend</a>, the captain of the school's football team. This served as a harsh reminder of the unfortunate news that he already knew - that Amy had a boyfriend. Just then, his best friend, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-matt.html">Matt</a>, appears and apologizes for being late. Noticing that Andrew was still upset, he reminds his friend that they have plans to go out to lunch, since pep rallies always mean half-days at school.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        Now at the restaurant, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Monkey See Monkey Eat</a>, Andrew excitedly takes his time looking over the menu, much to Matt's annoyance as he is starving. Matt wonders if the sudden rain has stopped, but realizes that it has not as he looks out the window. Andrew and Matt then overhear Amy scream. It just so happens that Amy is also at the restaurant with two of her friends, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Claire</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Elizabeth</a>, and the scream was an exaggerated sigh of annoyance, as the sudden lightning storm had caused her boyfriend's football game to be cancelled. At that moment, Andrew falls back into a depressed state. Matt tries to encourage his friend to finally say something to Amy, but their one sided conversation is cut short by a mysterious cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-ghold.html">figure</a> that barges into the establishment. Andrew asks Matt who it is, but Matt responds by asking how he should know. The figure throws off its rain-soaked cloak, revealing a humanoid creature with horns and metalic body parts as well as one of the five Talismans around its neck, particularly the one with black and white markings on it. The being nastily asks who is going to serve him, to which a hostess named <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Jess</a> nervously asks where he would like to sit. The monster then slams his hand onto the counter, cracking it and leaving a mark in the process. He shouts that he is not going to be sitting anywhere. He then goes on to explain that it is a special day, as if the sudden bad weather did not already give that away. He then tells the hostess to stop cowaring behind the desk and prepare for him a feast of unimaginable glory or else everyone there would die. We then see Amy's friend Elizabeth trying to get Amy's attention to sit down, as Amy is seemingly standing frozen in fear. Claire asks Elizabeth why she is just standing there, to which Elizabeth responds that she thinks that she is too scared to move. Claire thinks to herself that it must have something to do with Amy's recent nightmare in which a man wearing the same Talisman that the creature is wearing massacres dozens of innocent people including her own family. With the poor hostess also frozen in fear, the horned menace intends to stay true to his words as he prepars to strike her down, but a crying Amy suddenly shouts for the monster to stop. With the events reminding her of her recent nightmare, Amy declares that she does not want to watch anyone die, surprising and confusing everyone. Claiming she is brave, the figure decides to grant her an explanation on why he is there before killing her, stating that a pair of heroes named <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-cyborg-x.html">Cyborg X</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-shinobi.html">Shinobi</a> have recently appeared bringing with them a surge of hope and a longing for justice and that he wanted to remind the masses that malevolence was still as mighty as ever. This seems to be news to Andrew, as he has not heard of these two heroes, leaving Matt in disbelief of his friend's ignorance. The cyborg then<!-- <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">extends</a> --> extends one of his mechanical limbs over to Amy in an attempt to claim his new target as his first victim. Seeing Amy in danger, Andrew jumps up and tries attacking the monster, only for his punch to do no damage whatsoever. The creature instead brings Amy back towards him with his retractable arm and throws her into Andrew, sending the two flying into tables with a force that would surely leave anyone heavily injured. Miraculously, the strange pendant that was hanging around the being's neck had touched Andrew's hand during his desperate attack and had seemingly appeared around Andrew's neck instead. As the dust clears from the area where Andrew and Amy were thrown, Andrew stands holding Amy, the two of them unharmed. Andrew also seems to look slightly different, with his hair, eyebrows, and irises now black. The strands of hair that were hanging over his forehead are now going up with the rest of his hair, and some of the hair in the front separates into two different directions similarly to horns. Additionally, he has a curved, triangular marking under each eye. With Amy in his arms, everyone seems surprised, the monster included, and Andrew claims that he wants to give that punch another shot.

                                A legend tells of a time approximately 3,500 years ago when a temple was built to worship a strange race of beings who claimed to come from the sky and teach humans many things; however, it is said that the temple was meant to hide an orb that the beings brought with them, as they claimed that only Earth could hide it, but a long forgotten apocalyptic event may be the reason the temple now hides something else.

They make it past the door, and after narrowly escaping a deadly booby trap, they come across the five Talismans. One explorer betrays the other with the end result being unknown.
