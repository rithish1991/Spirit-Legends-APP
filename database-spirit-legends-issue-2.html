                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        After <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-andrew.html">Andrew</a> survives <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-ghold.html">Ghold's</a> attack and takes on a strange new appearance, Ghold wonders why Andrew now has his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Talisman</a>, why he looks different, and if he could be someone in particular. As Andrew helps <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-amy.html">Amy</a> stand and she backs away, Andrew wonders about a voice he heard and its mentioning of something about using energy from darkness. He claims that he does not really understand, but he wants to give his previous punch another shot. As Ghold keeps his grasp on the head of the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">restaurant</a> hostess, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Jess</a>, he tells Andrew not to get cocky and that Jess would die if Andrew made any sudden movements. He then tells Andrew to hand the Talisman to him so that things would not have to get so messy. Andrew asks if Ghold would spare everyone and leave if he gives the Talisman back to him, and Ghold says that Andrew has his word. As Andrew stares at the Talisman in his hand, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-matt.html">Matt</a> wonders what Andrew will do, and a tearful Amy remains speechless. Andrew raises the Talisman above him, and Ghold takes his hand off of his hotage as he prepares to take the Talisman back. Just then, Andrew surprises him by throwing a knife that he was hiding, which nicks the monster's right cheek. Before Ghold can retaliate, Andrew dashes up close to the distracted menace and delivers a punch powerful enough to send him flying through multiple booths and through a wall, landing outside of the restaurant and onto the pavement. The onloockers, including <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Claire</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Elizabeth</a>, are astonished, as well as Andrew himself. Matt approaches Andrew asking him if he is ok and states that what had happened was crazy. He asks Andrew what the Talisman is, but Andrew does not seem to know either. We see that Ghold is clearly unconscious.
                    </p>

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        As the patrons of the restaurant begin to crowd around Andrew and talk, Claire asks Amy if she is not going to thank Andrew, but Amy is stunned as she begins to see a resemblence between Andrew's new appearance and the murderous <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">figure</a> from her recent nightmare. Elizabeth then notices that it stopped raining and asks about it, but just then, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">lightning</a> strikes the ground near Ghold outside. As the bright light fades, another new mysterious cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-sihlvir.html">figure</a> appears from where the lightning had struck. Andrew and Matt wonder who this newcomer is, and the cloaked figure looks down at the unconscious Ghold.
                    </p>

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        The figure thinks back to earlier that day. Ghold and an elderly cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">figure</a> discuss a mysterious technology called the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">E5</a> at an unknown <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">location</a>. The elderly one states that it would seem that the E5 is a success, to which Ghold claims that it is great news, but the elderly one then clarifies himself, stating that the preparations were a success, so in theory the E5 will be too. Ghold then has a laugh at the elderly one's strange way of talking, but then the figure who had previously appeared when the lightning struck walks towards the two and asks what the deal is as they have had her Talisman for too long and that she did not like them using it. Revealing her name to be Sihlvir, Ghold tells her to relax as she is safe while the others are on watch. She then calls him an idiot, stating that that was not what she had meant. Ghold then asks if it is thoswe two so called heroes - <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-cyborg-x.html">Cyborg X</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-shinobi.html">Shinobi</a> - that she is scared of, but the elderly one interupts them telling them that that is enough. He explains that they needed her Talisman for the E5, but then clarifies with his strange way of speaking that it was chance that chose her Talisman when they had all drawn straws. Sihlvir then looks embarassed as Ghold laughs. The elderly one then states that their bickering brings up a good point, but then clarifies that it was Ghold's mentioning of Cyborg X and Shinobi that concerned him. Ghold then reassures him by claiming that while they play with the E5, which he playfully refers to as a little rain maker, he would play the part of the bait for the two heroes, which explains the true reason of why he seemingly randomly showed up at the restaurant.
                    </p>

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        We then are back in the present as Sihlvir wonders to herself if Cyborg X and Shinobi had defeated Ghold, who she refers to as Captain, and she wonders what exactly happened. A thin metallic tentacle-like pipe slithers out from her cloak as she prepares to pick up Ghold to carry him back to their base, but Andrew steps outside and gets Sihlvir's attention. She then notices Ghold's Talisman around Andrew's neck, and she wonders why he has it as she notices that it is indeed missing from around Ghold's neck. She yells to Andrew asking if he had stolen the Talisman, but he attempts to explain that it appeared on him when he touched it. In disbelief of Andrew's explanation, she reels back in her metallic tentacle and throws her cloak aside as she angrily and rhetorically asks how stupid Andrew thinks she is. With electricity now running around her metallic body, she begins to charge towards Andrew with a metallic tentacle now appearing from each of her two gauntlet-like forearms and exclaims that she will take the Talisman back from his thieving corpse. She then stops in her tracks when Ghold, who is now conscious, tells her to wait as Andrew is his. We see a strange dark energy flowing around Ghold's body that is also shaping into two large wings on each side of him. As Sihlvir smiles and Andrew looks nervous, Ghold then notices Cyborg X and Shinobi on the rooftop of the restaurant and deactivates his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">technique</a>. He tells Sihlvir to forget it as they are done here, to which Sihlvir confusedly asks why and begins to ask about the Talisman, but Ghold interupts her saying for them to go. Sihlvir angrily disagrees with Ghold's command as she tells him to forget that idea, but in her attempt to persuade Ghold to stay and fight, he yells at her, stating that it is an order. Before they leave, Ghold tells Andrew that he will reclaim the Talisman that he had stolen from him, and that when that time comes Andrew will die. Right then, Sihlvir retreats with Ghold in another bolt of lightning. Matt approaches Andrew to ask what he is going to do, but Andrew interupts him panicing and asking if he is going to die. Andrew then faints as we see Cyborg X and Shinobi looking down at the scene below and Matt yelling for Andrew to get up.

                                Sihlvir arrives to check on the situation. A flashback reveals that Nihkel had used Sihlvir's Talisman for an experiement with the E5, much to her displeasure. Ghold decided to lure Shinobi and Cyborg X away from their experiment by appearing somewhere and causing trouble, which winded up being the restaurant, Monkey See Monkey Eat. As we see now, that experiment concluded as Sihlvir now has her Talisman back.

Ghold orders her to stop as he activates a mysterious technique to attack Andrew by himself. However, he notices Shinobi and Cyborg X and realizes that his mission was a success.
