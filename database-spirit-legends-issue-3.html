A diner full of people were at risk, among them his best friend, Matt, and his unrequited love, Amy. Andrew drew upon the power of the amulet he accidentally took from Ghold and defeated the monster in a single blow. Even though back-up arrived for Ghold, he called a retreat, promising revenge.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        At <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-andrew.html">Andrew's</a> <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">high school</a>, his fellow classmates are standing far away from him and looking scared. We see an annoyed looking Andrew sitting at his desk with the surrounding desks pushed farther apart from him and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">PALADUS</a> members, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Leo Redfeld</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Clara Valentino</a>, guarding him. Andrew wonders how it came to this. He recalls what had happened a few days back on Friday at the restaurant, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Monkey See Monkey Eat</a>. After <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-sihlvir.html">Sihlvir</a> <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">fled</a> with the injured <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-ghold.html">Ghold</a>, a lot of people started showing up. At one point, he was asked to hand over the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Talisman</a>, but, since it kept reappearing on him, he was assigned the two agents, Leo and Clara, to watch over him. As he stares at the Talisman in his hand, he wonders if it is really him that the agents are protecting. <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-matt.html">Matt</a> shows up to greet Andrew, but he is stopped by Leo, who orders him to identify himself. Andrew tells Leo that Matt is with him and to stand down, and Matt realizes that Andrew was not exaggerating when he had previously told him that they were being overprotective. Andrew complains about how terrible the situation is, but Matt tries to cheer him up by reminding him that he is a hero since he saved all of the people in the restaurant including himself. He tells Andrew to think of it as having his own personal bodyguards, to which Andrew says that he does not know of any heroes who have to put up with this. Matt tells him to relax and remember that he saved <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-amy.html">Amy</a> on Friday, to which Andrew blushes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        Andrew then recalls that moment that he was attacked on Friday. While sitting against the wreckage of the table and dust all around him and Amy, who was in his arms, the now Talisman wearing Andrew found himself alone in what appeared to be a realm of darkness. After questioning if he was dead, it was there that Andrew met the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Dark Spirit</a> of the Talisman, who he initially mistook for the Grim Reaper. He pleaded for mercy, but the Dark Spirit reached out his hand to help him up as he properly introduced himself as one of the spirits within the Talisman. He explained that it seemed that Andrew was able to connect with him after coming in direct contact with the Talisman, to which Andrew remembered touching the mysterious pendant during his inital punch on its wielder, Ghold. Andrew asked where they were and where the Dark Spirit came from. The Dark Spirit explained that they were essentially inside Andrew's mind where time seemed to move slower as their meeting worked similarly to racing thoughts. He then explained that he was asleep for a long time and that he remembered connecting with <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">someone else</a> at one point but that he did not remember much beyond that. Andrew questioned if the "someone else" that he spoke of was Ghold, but since he did not know Ghold's name, he referred to him as "that horned guy". The Dark Spirit did not recall meeting with a horned guy, but he did feel that his powers were being tapped into through the seal on the Talisman as of late. Finding himself even more confused, Andrew asked about the powers and the seal. The Dark Spirit explained that he was a spirit capable of manipulating the element of darkness, like shadows, and that Andrew was somehow able to connect to him through the seal that was binding him inside the Talisman. He continued that it was a type of seal that reacts to emotions, but only for specific individuals. Andrew must have been a special person and that for this particular seal Andrew must have been under great distress. Andrew asked about the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">other spirit</a>, to which the Dark Spirit explained that, if he understood the seals correctly, if Andrew was more distressed over someone else then he might have met the other spirit instead, but it appeared that Andrew was more worried for himself at that moment that he was attacked. Before he could finish his sentence however, Andrew began to sulk as he wondered if that meant that he was selfish, but the Dark Spirit tried to cheer him up and told him that that was not the case, that it depended on the situation, and that it was just basic instinct. He then told Andrew that they did not have much time and that connecting with him would give Andrew a boost in power. Now that the element of darkness was in Andrew's grasp, the Dark Spirit said that Andrew should feel something different about himself. We then see that at that moment, Andrew had opened his eyes in the restaurant with a different appearance, and he agreed with the Dark Spirit.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        Back in the present, Andrew and Matt walk home from school with Leo and Clara closely behind them. Andrew complains about how the day was horrible because everyone was too afraid to talk to him, but Matt tries to cheer him up by telling him that at least he is safe. Andrew begins to respond, but he is interuppted by <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-cyborg-x.html">Cyborg X</a> who finishes Andrew's sentence and mocks both Leo and Clara. Along with him is <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-shinobi.html">Shinobi</a>. Cyborg X then casually tells the officers that it has been a while. The two respond by drawing their <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">guns</a> and running in front of Andrew and Matt, and Leo orders them to freeze as they are vigilantes who have been ignoring the law for too long now. Leo then asks why they are here, and Shinobi states that they have come to test the boy. Andrew asks if he is referring to him, but Leo then says that they cannot allow that and that the mysterious duo will have to come with them. Cyborg X and Shinobi look at each other, and Cyborg X states that he thought so. Shinobi then holds his right hand in a certain way while he lets out a roar. A paper tag on each of the two buildings to their left and right begin to glow, and a giant <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">wall of energy</a> forms, separating both Andrew and Matt from the rest of them. Leo begins to request for backup, and Shinobi surprises them by leaping over the wall to where both Andrew and Matt are. While Clara keeps her gun aimed at Cyborg X, Leo attempts to shoot at Shinobi through the strange barrier, but he realises that it is of no use as his bullets fail to penetrate the wall of energy. Shinobi reaches for one of the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">blades</a> on his back and tells Andrew to show him what he can do. Andrew tries to respond, but he is hit by a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">wave of energy</a> that shoots out from the blade that Shinobi swings. Andrew flies into the barrier, and Clara points out to Leo that there is a fire escape that they can use to go over the barrier. Before they could make their way to it however, Cyborg X <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">shoots</a> a blast of energy on the ground in front of them and tells them that he cannot have them interfering, not that he minds keeping them busy. Leo raises his gun to Cyborg X and says that he asked for it. Clara tries to remind Leo that their priority is protecting Andrew, but he asks her how she proposes to do that with Cyborg X in the way and that they will have to hope backup gets there soon. She looks at Andrew, who is seemingly unconscious and sitting on the ground against the barrier, and she says to herself for him to hang in there.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        Andrew finds himself back in his mind and calls for the Dark Spirit. After meeting again, Andrew states that he needs his help and requests that he lend Andrew his power like the other day, and the Dark Spirit says to go ahead. Confused, Andrew asks if he can give it to him now, but the Dark Spirit says that he can access it whenever he wants and clarifies even without his permission. He tells Andrew to try to tap into it like three days ago at his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">home</a>, which was the day he was assigned Leo and Clara to protect him. We then see those events. Andrew, who is sitting on his bed, tries to tap into the powers and takes on the same form that he did while at the restaurant earlier that day. In his mind, he calls for the Dark Spirit, although since he does not know his name, he initially refers to him as "Dark-Element-Spirit-of-Shadows-Guy", to which the Dark Spirit appears and tells him that just "Dark Spirit" is fine. Andrew thanks him for saving him earlier that day. The Dark Spirit tells him it was no problem, but it was actually Andrew who saved himself. Andrew pridefully but playfully tells him to stop as he is too kind, and the Dark Spirit laughs and states that maybe he is right as it was his power that he had used afterall. An embarassed Andrew thanks him for that, but then moves onto explaining that since he can connect with the Dark Spirit it seems the two of them are going to be together from now on. With his life now in danger, he asks if the Dark Spirit could maybe teach him a bit about this darkness stuff, to which the Dark Spirit responds by saying that was his thoughts exactly. He goes on to explain that the element of darkness is actually bountiful in nature and that he is not the only source, as Andrew will find. He continues to explain that it is an element relating to gravity, but like all elements, with proficient manipulation it can be shaped. By connecting with the Dark Spirit, Andrew should automatically be in a form in which they are fused in a sense. He tells Andrew to open his eyes, get a feel for what is now an elemental energy that Andrew contains within, and by using himself as a center for gravity try pulling something towards himself. Andrew does so and eventually slightly moves the left sleeve of his pullover sweater that is resting on his chair. He exclaims his excitement over doing it, and the Dark Spirit asks him if he can pull it off of the chair. Andrew tries to do this, and the sweater flies towards him and flies into his face. He excitedly celebrates and pops his head through the sweater. After jumping off the bed he realizes the way his sweater sits on his shoulders in his mirror. The Dark Spirit asks what the problem is, but Andrew says that it is nothing and that he just surprised himself is all. The Dark Spirit calls him a weird kid, to which an annoyed Andrew rhetorically asks him what was it he had said, but the Dark Spirit laughs and says it was nothing. Just then, Leo pops into his bedroom and asks if everythig is alright and who is he talking to, but Andrew snaps back at him saying that he is talking to himself and to beat it while the Dark Spirit continues to laugh.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                        Back in the present, Matt calls out Andrew's name and tells him to get up. As the energy of the attack that previously hit Andrew dissipates, we see that Andrew is once again in the fused form with the Dark Spirit. Shinobi quietly stares at Andrew and notices this. He then swings his sword once again and shoots out another wave of energy, startling Matt. This time however, Andrew opens his eyes and uses the power of darkness to manipulate the gravity around him and pop himself up off the ground and onto his feet, push Matt further back and potentially out of harm's way, and push the wave of energy around him like a shield. He drops his backpack to the ground and lifts his sweater over his shoulders like how it was when he noticed it in the mirror the other day. He then claims that he will take Shinobi's test and to watch him pass with flying colors.

                                At Andrew's school, everyone seems too scared to approach him because of Leo Redfeld and Clara Valentino guarding him. Andrew thinks back on how things had come to where they are now. After Sihlvir had fled with Ghold, a lot of people had shown up. At one point, Andrew was asked to hand over the Talisman, but since it kept reappearing on him, he was assigned the two PALADUS agents to watch over him.

Matt tries to cheer up Andrew by calling him a hero and reminding him that he saved Amy the other day. Andrew thinks back to the moment he and Amy were thrown by Ghold. At that moment, the Talisman that was around Ghold's neck had appeared on Andrew. It was then that he had met the Dark Spirit that was sealed within the Talisman. The two met and conversed inside Andrew's mind where time seemed to move slower. The Dark Spirit explained about himself and the Talisman to Andrew. Afterwards, Andrew used the Dark Spirit's power to defeat Ghold.

Shinobi, who claims that they had come to test Andrew, uses a technique to create a barrier and separate Andrew and Matt from the rest of them. Leo requests for backup, and Shinobi jumps over the barrier and challenges Andrew. He shoots a beam of energy by swinging his sword, which seemingly knocks out Andrew. Meanwhile, Cyborg X does battle with Leo and Clara in an attempt to keep them from interrupting Shinobi's test.

The Dark Spirit reminds Andrew of the other day when he taught him how to use the element of darkness. Shinobi shoots out another beam from his sword, and Andrew uses the element of darkness to pop himself off the ground, push Matt to safety, and block Shinobi's attack. He then tells Shinobi that he will take his test and pass with flying colors.
