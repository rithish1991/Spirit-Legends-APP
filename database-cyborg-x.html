                    When <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-ghold.html">Ghold</a> showed up at a local <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">restaurant</a> to bait both Cyborg X and Shinobi away from his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">group's</a> testing of the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">E5</a> at their <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">base</a>, Cyborg X intercepted text messages and phone calls from within the restaurant regarding the situation, and he and Shinobi showed up to assess the situation. Overlooking from the rooftop, they saw that both <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-sihlvir.html">Sihlvir</a> and Ghold were about to attack a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-andrew.html">boy</a> wearing Ghold's <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Talisman</a>. Ghold noticed the two heroes on the rooftop and stopped his attack. Despite Sihlvir's protests, the two monsters fled the scene in a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">bolt of lightning</a>, but not before Ghold threatened to eventually reclaim the Talisman and kill the boy. Cyborg X and Shinobi secretly overlooked the aftermath of the scene where police and a news crew showed up to the scene, and they watched as the paramilitary organization, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">PALADUS</a>, stepped in.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    Three days later, after Andrew was walking home from <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">school</a> with his best friend, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="database-matt.html">Matt</a> and the two PALADUS bodyguards, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Leo Redfeld</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Clara Valentino</a>, following closely behind them, Cyborg X and Shinobi made their appearance. Cyborg X interrupted Andrew and mocked the two guards, and they reacted by holding them at <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">gunpoint</a> and asking why they were there. Shinobi claimed that they came to test the boy, but Leo demanded that they come with them as they could not allow that. As this was what they predicted would happen, Cyborg X voiced this thought, and Shinobi created a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">barrier</a> separating himself, Cyborg X, Leo, and Clara from Andrew and Matt, prompting Leo to call for backup. Shinobi then jumped over the barrier and launched a strange <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">energy attack</a> from one of the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">two blades</a> that he grabbed from his back. The attack knocked Andrew into the barrier, causing him to seemingly pass out. Clara pointed out a fire escape that they could use to get over the barrier, but Cyborg X shot an energy projectile from his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">gun arm</a> and stated that he could not have them interfering, not that he minded keeping them busy. While Andrew and Shinobi started their battle, Cyborg X continued fighting with the two PALADUS bodyguards. Leo covered Clara while she ran up to and jumped toward the airborne Cyborg X. He attempted to shoot her with his gun arm, but Leo shot it with his handgun, which caused his arm to shoot in a different direction. Clara then stabbed him in his abdominal area and Cyborg X spit up blood. She kicked him downward back to the street below and redirected her attention to the fire escape once again. She called for Leo so that they could quickly head towards it, but Cybog X shot it down with his gun arm. As his body was <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">healing</a> from Clara's attack, he egged them on to continue their battle. After some more fighting, Leo stated that it looked like they would have to kick things up a notch, but then the barrier disappeared, to which Cyborg X took as a signal and noted that Shinobi and Andrew's battle was fast. Shinobi called to Cyborg X from a rooftop. With Andrew unconscious and over his shoulder, he said that he would leave the rest to him and threw a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">smoke bomb</a> below him. As the smoke cleared, he and Andrew were gone. Leo rushed to Matt as Clara kept her gun pointed to Cyborg X. Backup finally arrived, and a number of officers surrounded Cyborg X with guns while Leo discussed with one of the officers the situation. He explained that Shinobi disappeared with Andrew and that they would have to see if they could get any information out of Cyborg X, but before he could finish, the Cyborg X being held at gunpoint was revealed to be a hologram being projected from a small <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">device</a> on the ground. It let out a beeping noise before letting out a large sound wave that pushed some of the officers and their cars away. The real Cyborg X then ran up behind Matt and pointed his gun arm at his head claming that it was about time he wrap things up on his end as well.

His skin under the helmet is fair, and on his cheeks are gray metallic markings. On the outside of the helmet are two gray circular nubs where his ears are. On his upper torso he wears blue metallic armor that reveals a thin black cloth-like material around his abdominal area, neck, collarbones, and upper arms. His forearms are also each covered in a blue metallic armor with gray coloring on both ends. Due to his ability to manipulate his body structure, he typically changes one or both of his hands, which are also covered in a thin black cloth-like material, to a cylindrical gun barrel with tiny, long circular holes around it. From this gun barrell he shoots energy projectiles. Around his neck and collarbones are a yellow metallic collar connected to blue metallic shoulder pads. His groin area has a blue metallic armor with yellow markings, and his thighs are covered in the same thin, black cloth-like material. His lower legs are covered in blue metallic armor and gray colored metal around the area where his knees are. This blue metallic armor goes all the way down to his feet, which are also covered.</p>

As a result, continuous useage of this ability will eventually drain him of his energy and stamina. In this case, he would have to rest to recover. This ability is highly versatile, though, as he can regenerate wounds and even missing limbs as well as form different mechanical objects such as changing his hand into a gun barrel for his X Cannon or even creating jets on his back for flight. The cybernetic parts of his body can also intercept various communications and even download massive amounts of data to his brain.</p>
