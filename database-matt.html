                    <p class="database_article_text">During a pep rally at his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">school</a>, Matt was looking for his best friend, Andrew, who was sulking on the bleachers after witnessing his unrequited love, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Amy</a> leap into the arms of her <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">boyfriend</a>. After apologizing to Andrew for being late, and noticing that Andrew was still upset, he reminded his friend that they had plans to go out to lunch, since pep rallies always meant half-days at school.
                    </p>

                    <div class="database_article_image_left">

                    </div>

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    Now at a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">restaurant</a>, Andrew and Matt overheard Amy scream. It just so happened that Amy was also as the restaurant with two of her friends, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Claire</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Elizabeth</a>, and the scream was an exaggerated sigh of annoyance, as a sudden lightning storm had caused her boyfriend's football game to be cancelled. At that moment, Andrew fell back into a depressed state. Matt tried to encourage his friend to finally say something to Amy, but their one sided conversation was cut short by a mysterious cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">figure</a> that barged into the establishment demanding to the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">hostess</a> for food or else everyone there would die. With the poor girl frozen in fear, the horned menace intended to stay true to his words as he prepared to strike her down, but a crying Amy suddenly shouted for the monster to stop. With the events feeling eerily similar to a recent nightmare she experienced where many people died in front of her, Amy declared that she did not want to watch anyone die, surprising and confusing everyone. Claiming she was brave, the figure decided to grant her an explanation on why he was there before killing her, stating that a pair of heroes named <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Cyborg X</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Shinobi</a> had recently appeared bringing with them a surge of hope and a longing for justice and that he wanted to remind the masses that malevolence was still as mighty as ever. This seemed to be news to Andrew, as he had not heard of these two heroes, leaving Matt in disbelief of his friend's ignorance. The cyborg then extended one of his mechanical limbs over to Amy in an attempt to claim his new target as his first victim. Matt then witnessed his friend jump up and attempt to attack the monster after seeing Amy in danger. Unfortunately, it seemed that his punch did no damage whatsoever, and the creature responded by bringing Amy back towards him with his retractable arm and throwing her into Andrew, sending the two flying into tables with a force that would surely leave anyone heavily injured.

                    As the dust cleared from the area where Andrew and Amy were thrown, Matt saw Andrew stand holding Amy, the two of them unharmed. On top of that, Andrew seemed to be wearing the strange <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">pendant</a> that was formerly around the monster's neck. Despite the villain's demands for the Talisman back as well as using the poor hostess as a hostage, Andrew successfully landed a second hit on the metallic gut of the cyborg, sending him flying through multiple booths before crashing through the wall and landing outside unconscious, surprising everyone. Matt joined in celebrating his friend's victory, but it was cut short as, even though the storm had passed, lightning struck the ground near the unconscious monster, revealing another cloaked <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">creature</a>. Matt watched from the hole in the wall as, with some newfound confidence, Andrew approached this new figure, who noticed that Andrew was wearing the Talisman that was around the other monster's neck, revealing that the two creatures were in fact allies. Before she could attempt to take it back, the unconscious monster woke up and ordered for her to stop, as he wanted to get revenge; however, while powering up a strange cloak of darkness around himself, he ultimately decided to stop as he, unbeknownst to the others, noticed the duo, Cyborg X and Shinobi, on the roof of the restaurant. The two monsters fled the scene in a bolt of lightning, but not before the injured one threatened to eventually reclaim the Talisman and kill Andrew. Matt was there for his friend, who seemed to pass out after the fear from hearing the threat set in.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    Eventually, police showed up to the scene as well as a news crew, who reported on the events. Matt was with Andrew throughout these events. When it seemed the Talisman continually reappeared around Andrew's neck and was unable to be separated from Andrew and taken in as evidence and secured, the paramilitary organization, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">PALADUS</a>, stepped in and assigned two agents, <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Leo Redfeld</a> and <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Clara Valentino</a>, to act as bodyguards who would watch over and protect Andrew as well as the Talisman. After that, Matt had not seen Andrew for the rest of the weekend.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    When Monday morning rolled around, Matt attempted to approach Andrew, but was stopped and questioned by Leo, as the two bodyguards were with Andrew, causing everyone to be too scared to be anywhere near him. An annoyed Andrew claimed that Matt was with him and for them to stand down. Matt tried to cheer Andrew up by telling him to think of the situation as him having his own personal bodyguards on top of the good news of him saving everyone three days ago, including Amy.

                    <p class="database_article_text">
                    After school, Andrew and Matt were walking home with Leo and Clara behind them. All of a sudden, Cyborg X and Shinobi appeared claiming that they were there to test Andrew. Before Leo and Clara could interfere, Shinobi created a <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">barrier</a> separating himself, Cyborg X, Leo, and Clara from Andrew and Matt, prompting Leo to call for backup. Shinobi then jumped over the barrier and launched a strange <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">energy attack</a> from one of the <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">two blades</a> that he grabbed from his back. The attack knocked Andrew into the barrier, causing him to seemingly pass out. While Cyborg X prevented Leo and Clara from any attempts to get to Andrew, Shinobi launched another attack at Andrew, to which Andrew reacted by using his gravity powers to push himself off the floor, push Matt out of the way, and deflect the attack, claiming that he would pass Shinobi's test with flying colors. Matt watched on as Andrew and Shinobi faught, which ended with Andrew falling unconscious ontop of Shinobi before he could strike him with his <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">Shadow Claw</a> technique. Freaking out a bit, Matt asked Shinobi if Andrew was okay, but Shinobi assured him that he only passed out from overusing his powers and that he was not the bad guy. He told Matt that there were things going on that he could never imagine and that he needed to make sure that Andrew was ready to face the worst. He claimed that Andrew had a lot to learn but he had the will to do so. Matt asked if it was true that it really was just a test, and Shinobi reassured him that it was and that Andrew passed. Matt watched as Shinobi left the battlefield with an unconscious Andrew.

                    Leo ran towards Matt asking him if everything was okay. Backup finally arrived and told Cyborg X to stand right where he was and that he was under arrest. Unbeknownst to everyone, Cyborg X slipped away and what they were pointing their guns at was actually just a hologram of Cyborg X coming from a small <a class="database_article_text_link" href="#">device</a> that he left on the ground. The device unleashed a blast of sound, knocking back the police who were standing around the device. The real Cyborg X came out of hiding and appeared behind Matt. Pointing his gun arm to Matt's head, he stated that it was time that he wrap things up on his end as well.

                    <p class="database_article_text">Matt is a very friendly person, supporting those he cares about whenever possible. One of the things he cannot stand is bullying, so his determined and strong-willed nature causes him to butt into such situations. Thankfully, he has enough smarts to usually call off the confrontation before it can escalate, making him the perfect supportive friend to Andrew. He is not necessarily a genius; however; he is of slightly above average intelligence and very good with his use of words. He is the one to either teach or remind his naive friend of any current events or facts that are usually well known. Speaking of Andrew, just like his friend, Matt also loves playing video games.</p>
